## PYTHON- DATA STRUCTURES: LISTS, TUPLES.
# LISTS!
A list is one of the most versatile data structures in Python. It is an ordered collection of items that can hold elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats, or even other lists). Lists are mutable, which means you can modify, add, or remove elements after the list is created.<br>
You can create a list in Python using square brackets [] and separating elements with commas.<br>
For example:<br>
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
mixed_list = [10, 'hello', 3.14, True]
# TUPLES!
A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning its elements cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are often used for fixed collections of items.<br>
You create a tuple using parentheses () and separating elements with commas.<br>
For example:<br>
numbers_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
fruits_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'orange')
