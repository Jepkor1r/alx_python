## Introduction



## Args and Kwargs

In Python, functions can accept a variable number of arguments. `args` and `kwargs` are common terms used to represent this flexibility:

- `args`: This is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function. They are received as a tuple within the function.
- `kwargs`: This is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments (i.e., arguments that are specified with a name) to a function. They are received as a dictionary within the function.

## JSON Encoder and Decoder
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. Python provides built-in modules for encoding Python objects into JSON format (json.dumps()) and decoding JSON data back into Python objects (json.loads()).

Example:

python
Copy code
import json

data = {"key": "value"}
json_data = json.dumps(data)  # Encoding Python object to JSON
decoded_data = json.loads(json_data)  # Decoding JSON data to Python object

## Unittest Module
The unittest module is part of Python's standard library and provides a framework for writing and executing unit tests. Unit tests help ensure that individual components or functions of your code are working as expected.

Example:

import unittest

class TestExample(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        result = 2 + 2
        self.assertEqual(result, 4)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
