## PYTHON INHERITANCE
Inheritance is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows you to create a <strong> new class (known as the subclass or derived class)</strong> based on an <strong>existing class (known as the superclass or base class)</strong>.<br>
The subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass, which helps in reusing code and creating a hierarchy of classes.<br>
Think of it, like a family relationship where you have a parent and a child. The parent is the "base class," and the child is the "subclass."
